            <div class="post-content">
                <p> I have had a long standing interest in the stock market and the various fluctuations of prices. I have
                always wondered whether it would be possible to collate enough data such as a company fundamentals, couple it
                with various changes in price and make predictions. While im sure this is already being done somewhere, the first step this week for me was getting to grips with the basics.</p>

                <p>Brexit-The Uncivil war, was an eye opening drama. It highlighted the power
                of computers and the digital world in being able to influence very real people.
                It was after this experience that my interest in programming really took off.</p>
                <p>I began with learning HTML, CSS and JAVA-script. As part of my degree I was taught the basics of
                Python as well as some core modules such as Numpy and Matplotlib. The next part of my campaign
                is going to be conquering machine learning and taking a stab at data science.</p>
